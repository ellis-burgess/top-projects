        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There's nothing more comforting than noodle soup. This recipe is made by Taylerand20, and taken from <a href="https://allrecipes.com">allrecipes.com</a>.</p>
        <p>I always make myself noodle soup when I'm ill, but also tend to eat it on a regular basis! To make it exceptionally easy, you can use frozen mixed veggies and just toss them in some bouillon for 10 minutes or so before adding the noodles.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 large carrots, diced</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, diced</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>12 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>3 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package wide vegan noodles</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm olive oil in large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, celery, and onion and cook, stirring only occasionally, until lightly browned in spots and starting to get tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Add broth, herbes de Provence, bay leaves, and black pepper to the pot with the vegetables and bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While broth simmers, bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook noodles until tender but still firm to the bite, about 7 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and toss noodles with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Remove soup from heat and stir in chickpeas, parsley, and lemon juice. Ladle soup into bowls, adding noodles to each bowl right before serving.</li>
        </ol>
